[Austen Allred] 12:01:24
Hey, everybody. Welcome. Welcome. Thanks for joining us. We're going to give people just a couple minutes to give people a couple minutes Jump in here.

[Austen Allred] 12:01:36
Apologies, I've uh Got a cold, so hopefully it won't bother us, but if I cough My bad. Also.

[Austen Allred] 12:01:47
Notice that this is being transcribed and recorded, so we'll send it out to folks who can't join. We've got A handful of people, it looks like, who registered for a past webinar and registered for this webinar as well.

[Austen Allred] 12:02:02
So there's definitely gonna be some Repetition, apologies for that, but we'll figure it out. We've got the Q&A turned on.

[Austen Allred] 12:02:11
I'll go through a very, very high level. And I just realized I may be wearing the exact same clothes that I was wearing for last webinar a week ago.

[Austen Allred] 12:02:19
If that's the case, that's entirely an accident. Sorry, that just distracted me because I was thinking about that. So first I'm going to go through a very bare bones presentation.

[Austen Allred] 12:02:29
That explains some of the questions that I know are going to be asked.

[Austen Allred] 12:02:33
And then we'll jump into the Q&A. So go ahead and use that Q&A section for the questions that you may have.

[Austen Allred] 12:02:40
With that, we're going to share screen, share a Chrome, hit slideshow, boom, here we go.

[Austen Allred] 12:02:46
Gauntlet AI. Why is Gauntlet AI a thing? What is happening? What is all this hullabaloo and why are we all here? So it started a little over a year ago, actually almost exactly a year ago.

[Austen Allred] 12:03:00
They're actually a little less than a year ago. I take that back.

[Austen Allred] 12:03:03
When we started working with a handful of companies to train their engineering teams to use AI So, you know, we… We're the same umbrella company as BloomTech, or which used to be Lambda school so We've been training software engineers for a very, very long time. And all of a sudden, every company was saying, we want people that know AI. We asked, what does that mean? Nobody really knew.

[Austen Allred] 12:03:29
So the origins of all this are we sent out a research team to figure out what was actually working within AI, what engineers could do to use AI to build stuff faster. We started training companies the biggest company that basically

[Austen Allred] 12:03:44
I think they sent more than 100 students and our very first cohort was Trilogy, who we've now partnered with.

[Austen Allred] 12:03:50
As one of the three companies behind Gauntlet. But what we saw was pretty crazy.

[Austen Allred] 12:03:56
Hire almost more engineers than anybody else on the planet. They're up there. And they saw, you know, across the their teams of 50% net increase in productivity, which they measure religiously And then they saw it again the next quarter. And so we're like, okay, they've basically doubled productivity in six months.

[Austen Allred] 12:04:17
There's a there there. Something crazy is happening. And so we believe that AI is the biggest force multiplier in human history. And you combine that with how difficult it is to get an existing engineering team to train all of their principal, to change all of their practices, to change everything that they do.

[Austen Allred] 12:04:35
And they're like, you know what, this also fundamentally changes who We are, and they basically came to me and said, we've got a few companies that want to do something like we did in the 90s.

[Austen Allred] 12:04:50
Which was called Trilogy University in the 90s. So we want to do something extremely intensive, find engineers and train them to be on the absolute cutting edge of AI.

[Austen Allred] 12:05:00
We'll pay for it all. We'll fly everybody to Austin. We'll house everybody. We'll feed everybody And they're going to pay us to actually run the training.

[Austen Allred] 12:05:13
And that's basically what gauntlet AI is. We believe that AI is the biggest force multiplier in human history. So when you've got companies with deep pockets that are trying to figure out how to unlock that. This is the play of doing that.

[Austen Allred] 12:05:31
And obviously that's the reason it's the reason

[Austen Allred] 12:05:38
I just saw an email. I think

[Austen Allred] 12:05:39
The estimates for the housing alone are in the millions. So these companies are very, very serious about this. And we're very, very excited.

[Austen Allred] 12:05:49
So basically it's four weeks remote and then eight weeks all expenses paid in Austin, Texas. It is extremely intense. We are going to be working nonstop basically every waking hour for most of the 12 weeks. An awesome portion, there's more

[Austen Allred] 12:06:07
Socializing and hanging out and some group activities and more stuff like that. And that's obviously part of the long hour hours that we say are a requirement. And then, you know, anybody who completes the gauntlet receives an automatic offer from one of the three companies will have a matching process later on

[Austen Allred] 12:06:29
Toward the end where you say which companies you want to work at, the companies look at what their needs are.

[Austen Allred] 12:06:36
They're individual companies that they're individual companies within those three that would hire everybody. So there's not going to be an instance where you know, I think if I took everybody that we have accepted so far and doubled it, they would be able to handle that number and more.

[Austen Allred] 12:06:54
It's not a uh… They want to make sure that they're hiring people that are qualified and who have gotten through gauntlet. But the admissions process was very, very strict. So if you're here, congratulations.

[Austen Allred] 12:07:08
And we're really, really, I mean. I get to sit on my end and look through the dashboards of the LinkedIn profiles of people who are who've accepted and it's It's a pretty killer group. I'm really, really excited.

[Austen Allred] 12:07:25
Eligibility requirements, if you're here you met them selection criteria, if you're here, you've checked those boxes. This is the initial instruction team. Zach's going to be your TA. Ash is helping us coordinate the course.

[Austen Allred] 12:07:41
Aaron works full time in AI. He's an ex-Googler, the whole nine yards. He's our lead instructor. Tom is in the UK. He's our other lead instructor.

[Austen Allred] 12:07:53
Both pretty brilliant. Steve helps on the data side and with curriculum design And with all of this, there's going to be a disclaimer that we're going to add more people as time goes along.

[Austen Allred] 12:08:02
The funny thing about AI is if someone spent a year using generative AI to build products, they're like, that's like the top That's as long as it can be. Maybe a couple of years. So we look for folks that are experts and work full time in AI.

[Austen Allred] 12:08:21
And we're going to get into this. Not everything is going to be direct instruction. There's going to be a lot of direct instruction. We're also going to bring in guest speakers.

[Austen Allred] 12:08:29
Learn a lot together. We're going to be a lot of the times building projects and, you know, having office hours as you hit roadblocks, stuff like that. But those are the people. The curriculum is broken down into kind of two parts. So there's kind of six iterations.

[Austen Allred] 12:08:47
If I were talking about working out, I'd say there's, you know.

[Austen Allred] 12:08:50
Six, a superset that each contain two things. Each of those is a week. So the first week.

[Austen Allred] 12:08:58
Imagine the simplest way to describe what we're doing is imagine an app and I'll give you a hint as to what week one will be.

[Austen Allred] 12:09:06
We'll say, hey, there's Slack or Mattermost or Rocket Chat or, you know, these big multi-way messaging file sharing, indexing, searching.

[Austen Allred] 12:09:19
Apps that you would use at work, we're going to build a production grade ready to deploy, deployed in the entirety of one of those applications in a single week.

[Austen Allred] 12:09:32
We're going to do that along the way. We're teaching you how to use AI to do that. So we start off with stuff like prompting and prompting and prompting and prompting AI first development. And then, you know, so that gives you an idea of what to look forward to in week one. You're going to be building

[Austen Allred] 12:09:50
A production ready variant of Slack in a single week. And you're going to be using AI to do basically all of it and You're going to be learning a hell of a lot along the way. And we also, there are blocks for direct instruction.

[Austen Allred] 12:10:06
Where the projects are aligned with the things that we were teaching you that week.

[Austen Allred] 12:10:12
And there's obviously going to be a lot of stuff that you learn that we don't teach you. And we like to make it very, very clear that you're going to stumble upon things that we've never seen just because that's how

[Austen Allred] 12:10:24
Ai works. And so there are time blocks built in for self-study and we'll show you, we'll talk about all that Then the second week is the AI evolution of that app. So you're going to take, as an example, your Slack clone that you built in week one and build a bunch of cutting edge AI features. You can kind of take your pick from some of them.

[Austen Allred] 12:10:50
In the second week. So that's going to be more, here's the stuff that was impossible before AI. We're going to build out that.

[Austen Allred] 12:10:58
Whereas week one is let's get really, really good at building projects using AI first development really quickly.

[Austen Allred] 12:11:07
So our mental model is you should never really be writing the first pass of code. Ai should be doing basically everything and then you're tweaking and you're massaging, but you're going to spend a lot more time tweaking data and massaging prompts, then you're going to be actually writing code.

[Austen Allred] 12:11:25
And I think that's Yeah, I'm not going to get into philosophizing about that.

[Austen Allred] 12:11:30
So logistics and overview. If you're in, you've got to sign the commitment letter by January 4th.

[Austen Allred] 12:11:36
We've got a separate handbook that we'll be sending out to everybody hopefully in the next 12 hours as soon as you've signed.

[Austen Allred] 12:11:43
We are in the process of onboarding everybody who has signed. So the first couple of things you'll be onboarded onto.

[Austen Allred] 12:11:51
Is you'll get to gauntletai.com email address and you'll be added to our official Slack channel.

[Austen Allred] 12:11:58
Some of those are even some of the Google emails are hitting spam. So keep an eye out for that. We've had to call a few people and say, hey.

[Austen Allred] 12:12:07
You have an openness as it hits spam and it has. So we'll keep an eye on that.

[Austen Allred] 12:12:13
The move to Austin Day is February 3rd. The companies cover all the accommodations, all the flights. So don't buy any flights. Don't book anything. Just be prepared for that.

[Austen Allred] 12:12:28
And then basically immediately following Gauntlet Everybody who's still participating gets an offer from a company and you start basically as soon as you can.

[Austen Allred] 12:12:42
We'll send out some of these resources. There's prep work you can do if you want to do some work over the weekend. There's an unofficial Discord that folks have jumped in, but you're probably going to be in the official Slack sooner than later.

[Austen Allred] 12:12:55
We'll send out a curriculum. We have last week's webinar recording. Wow, that was tricky to say, that will mostly be a copy of this, but we'll send this out as well.

[Austen Allred] 12:13:06
And that's it. So that's the high level. Now I want to spend a lot of time jumping into the Q&A.

[Austen Allred] 12:13:14
Um… All right. Are you going to cover relocation expenses? I believe yes.

[Austen Allred] 12:13:24
The… It's not going to be like… Yeah, it's not going to be super crazy, but yeah, we'll help you get to Austin and get all your stuff to Austin.

[Austen Allred] 12:13:34
And when I say we, I mean, that's the company. It's not me. I can't afford that.

[Austen Allred] 12:13:41
What systems are in place to prevent student burnout? So we'll be using software that's kind of a time monitoring and tracking system to help you all schedule and manage your time and stuff like that. So we'll be watching that but

[Austen Allred] 12:13:58
Um the It's going to be super intense. I'm not going to lie to you guys. You're going to be spending pretty much every waking hour working on stuff and learning as fast as you can.

[Austen Allred] 12:14:10
So if you're somebody who's super prone to burnout, you should probably Talk to us ahead of time.

[Austen Allred] 12:14:17
There are going to be fantastic accommodations for that. That's just the honest reality.

[Austen Allred] 12:14:25
Yeah, so this is a really, really good question. What's included in the 80 to 100 hours? Most of it is going to be learning and building.

[Austen Allred] 12:14:36
Definitely have time periods Learning, and I should say you're largely going to be in control of your own schedule. This isn't like I mean, we'll have stuff that's required, obviously, if there's like a lesson or a group dinner or stuff like that.

[Austen Allred] 12:14:53
The… But we're trying to pack so much into 12 weeks that it's just going to be pretty intense. The way I think about it, and we do include like the We're doing group dinners and we're doing the socializing aspect that's included in those 80 to 100 hour weeks.

[Austen Allred] 12:15:13
So it's not necessarily You're writing code for all 80 to 100 hours.

[Austen Allred] 12:15:21
And I think the blunt answer for why are we expected to work so much when research shows productivity plummets We just need to get as much done as we possibly can in 12 weeks. I don't fully I mean, I have yet to see a study that says you know you're

[Austen Allred] 12:15:39
Productivity is negative after the first 40 hours or 50 hours and we've seen pretty opposite stuff at most startups. So we're just doing as much as we can in as little time as we can.

[Austen Allred] 12:15:56
Yeah, this is an excellent question. How much the program is teaching us how to do stuff versus testing if we can do stuff.

[Austen Allred] 12:16:06
One of the reasons the admissions bar is so high toward general intelligence is that… the people who have the highest level of general intelligence are the fastest at learning how to do stuff.

[Austen Allred] 12:16:23
And we were definitely going to teach you a lot of stuff, like all the core, all of the basics. We're going to have actual direct instruction where we have an instructor.

[Austen Allred] 12:16:34
Sit there and it's probably not the most Well, pedagogical studies show it's not the most effective way to learn things, but it's definitely the fastest way to transmit information is just direct instruction.

[Austen Allred] 12:16:49
And then there are definitely parts where you can't rely on somebody building a new course forever. So a lot of what we teach is how to become a voracious learner, how to find the right resources, how to use those right resources.

[Austen Allred] 12:17:06
How to build second brains. We call those brain lifts. And we feed them, we build them both for ourselves and to feed to models. So we'll talk pretty extensively about all of that.

[Austen Allred] 12:17:17
So there's definitely aspects of it that you need to learn.

[Austen Allred] 12:17:22
And that's Yeah.

[Austen Allred] 12:17:25
I don't know how to what to do with the way the question is worded of like as if it's a dichotomy of learning to do stuff or testing if we can do stuff. A lot of the time we are going to be learning by doing stuff.

[Austen Allred] 12:17:38
But the purpose is much more to learn than it is to test you guys.

[Austen Allred] 12:17:45
If you made it this far, we know that you're smart to be totally blunt about it.

[Austen Allred] 12:17:50
Now we need to see if you can work really hard and if you'll keep learning and working.

[Austen Allred] 12:17:59
Yeah, that's a good question. You say it's originally designed for new grads. Does this include boot camp grads or only CS degree grads?

[Austen Allred] 12:18:07
The short answer to that is we actually, so we originally designed it for, we'll say recent CS grads, right? But as we looked at it, we said, you know, with AI the way that it is.

[Austen Allred] 12:18:19
It's far less important what your background is. And we care far more about your horsepower. So your raw intelligence, your ability to learn You have to be able to write some level of code, but as most of you probably saw.

[Austen Allred] 12:18:35
The intelligence portion uh of The application process was a lot more exclusive than the code portion. We could have said, you know, you have to be in the 90th percentile of writing code.

[Austen Allred] 12:18:49
And we didn't. We kept it pretty basic because A, we think that AI is going to be writing most of the code for you. So using the proper syntax when you code is far less important today than it would have been 10 years ago.

[Austen Allred] 12:19:01
But also, if there are any gaps, what you're going to be expected to pick them up along the way.

[Austen Allred] 12:19:07
So people are going to be coming from different, I mean, we've, to give you an idea, we've got boot camp grads, we've got I'm not sure if they'll join. We've got a couple 17-year-olds that haven't even graduated high school yet, but have been

[Austen Allred] 12:19:20
Building stuff on their own for a long time. And we've got PhDs. So there's a broad, you know, as far as educational background goes

[Austen Allred] 12:19:32
But AI is going to be pretty new for all of us. And that's the most important thing.

[Austen Allred] 12:19:37
So yeah. I have ADHD. Can I expect any support for that specifically? You should talk to me. I'm also diagnosed with ADHD.

[Austen Allred] 12:19:48
Generally, what we found when we have talked to folks who've been diagnosed with ADHD is that the key is to enter flow state as quickly as you can and to enter hyper focus. And people with ADHD tend to do actually really, really well.

[Austen Allred] 12:20:03
At this type of learning. But yeah, you should talk to us.

[Austen Allred] 12:20:15
Yeah, so the Yeah, the question here is basically Are there going to be different expectations as to the hours based on the skill level.

[Austen Allred] 12:20:28
I'll say this. So I went to a very intensive Russian learning school where I, you know, I, walked into the school not having spoken a word of Russian and I walked in with a bunch of people who had been studying Russian for

[Austen Allred] 12:20:43
Years in high school and whatever else. Within a couple of weeks, we were all in pretty much the same spot.

[Austen Allred] 12:20:51
And where this is being able to code really well is going to be helpful.

[Austen Allred] 12:20:56
But what we're really learning is more about the code or more, sorry, more about AI than the code.

[Austen Allred] 12:21:01
So I wouldn't expect to have dramatically lower hours and you know the hours are there to be clear.

[Austen Allred] 12:21:11
We're not going to sit there and say, hey, you only put in 79 hours. You're going to want slash need to put in the hours to get the stuff Duh. Done. And you're never going to have done more than enough time and be bored.

[Austen Allred] 12:21:29
But we do want this to be your basically the only thing that you're really focused on We want it to be super intensive and there's just whole lot that we need to cover in 12 weeks. So I basically… Suffice it to say, I anticipate the bar to be pretty much the same for everybody.

[Austen Allred] 12:21:49
As far as hours put in. Some people are going to get further than others but You won't be bored, that's for sure

[Austen Allred] 12:22:00
All right. What are the three companies and what are the roles? So there are three main companies. One is Trilogy.

[Austen Allred] 12:22:08
And they founded Trilogy University in the 90s. And the simplest way to think about Trilogy is they own and operate somewhere in the realm of 150 to 200 different software companies. Some they've bought, some they have They just operate, some they've started. Most they've bought over the years.

[Austen Allred] 12:22:31
And so they have different divisions within Trilogy. They have divisions where you're trying to make the operations of the existing companies more efficient. They have, and they're very, the reason they're very, very interested in AI is I mean, obviously, if you own that many companies, if you can

[Austen Allred] 12:22:52
Write an agent at one company that does X, you can then deploy it across all 150 companies or the companies where it's relevant. And that's, you know, so they have kind of a platform-y hot style of engineering. And then they have people who are working on the individual companies, but they're also

[Austen Allred] 12:23:11
They're as a result of AI, they're breaking out a ventures division where they want to build new companies and have the people that are building those companies share in the economics of that.

[Austen Allred] 12:23:23
And then they have a capital division that's more around finding companies to buy, finding ways to or do research to figure out how to make companies more efficient. So that's company one, Trilogy.

[Austen Allred] 12:23:36
The next company is a portfolio of education companies. So they own private and charter schools all over the US. They also own a whole bunch of different education based apps, both that they use internally.

[Austen Allred] 12:23:51
And some that they deploy and are going to begin selling.

[Austen Allred] 12:23:57
Some they do sell, some they're going to sell begin or keep selling. They're very, very interested in how AI plays a role in education. So they're building stuff like screen monitoring or eye vision tracking to make To go beyond the basic AI tutor that you can kind of get out of the box now, how do you help kids learn really, really effectively?

[Austen Allred] 12:24:19
And then the third company is probably the most exciting, I would argue, but they are so stealthy and the founders are so well known in the space that they are in.

[Austen Allred] 12:24:29
That they have asked me not even to… say what space it is.

[Austen Allred] 12:24:35
But they are extremely stealthy. And I think they come out of stealth in a few weeks. So you'll be able to To hear more about that company as we go throughout the cohort.

[Austen Allred] 12:24:46
And then the roles, there are all sorts of various roles from, you know, just a generic AI engineer to people who are focused on vision to people who are focused on operations but It's all just AI.

[Austen Allred] 12:25:01
Based.

[Austen Allred] 12:25:07
And that's kind of a duplicate of that one. All right. My laptop computer is pretty old. I'm considering getting a new one for Austin. Any recommendation for platform and specs for the work we'll be doing?

[Austen Allred] 12:25:20
So the short answer is most of the Hardcore compute will be happening in the cloud.

[Austen Allred] 12:25:27
So you don't have to have the newest, greatest computer to make things work really well.

[Austen Allred] 12:25:36
So I'd probably just be giving you my own bias. I think Mac is a little easier to use in most modern workspaces.

[Austen Allred] 12:25:44
But I will say if you have a laptop that works really well and you're going to be taking a job with one of the companies after the fact, they're going to give you a new computer at that point.

[Austen Allred] 12:25:55
Don't go too crazy buying expensive computers for this, if you have something that's gonna work.

[Austen Allred] 12:26:02
Because you're probably less than three months away from getting a new one. So take that into consideration.

[Austen Allred] 12:26:10
How many people have been accepted so far? I don't have the number right in front of me.

[Austen Allred] 12:26:16
I believe we just hit 200 acceptances. And obviously a lot of those are a lot of those people who weren't sure if they were going to be able to do it or not. So my best guess as to how many people actually join

[Austen Allred] 12:26:33
It's probably around 120, 130, but we'll see. I mean, there are a lot of people that they're like, oh, wow, I can't believe I actually got in, can I defer until the next one? We're like, we don't know if there's going to be a next one um but

[Austen Allred] 12:26:48
Yeah, that gives you an idea. And we have had several thousand applications. So I think we're less than a 5% acceptance rate, somewhere in that range.

[Austen Allred] 12:27:00
You mentioned you already ran one program with Trilogy. How did that go? Yeah, so that was us training their Trilogy's engineers. And like I said, I mean, they've built 75 agents that they've deployed within Trilogy as a result.

[Austen Allred] 12:27:16
Their net productivity is, you know, they, they. These are numbers from them. They said they saw the first quarter we rolled stuff out. They saw a net across the entire engineering team productivity increase of 50%.

[Austen Allred] 12:27:31
And then the next quarter, they saw another 50% increase. So combining those two, they more than doubled their engineering productivity.

[Austen Allred] 12:27:39
With the number of engineers that they have, that would have been, I mean, and they've been optimizing that for a decade. So it's… Pretty crazy. Yeah. And then, uh.

[Austen Allred] 12:27:51
If you're referring to Trilogy University, Trilogy University was a program they ran in the 90s and was phenomenally successful.

[Austen Allred] 12:27:59
You can look up the trilogy grads And where they're at today. And it's not quite a who's who of who's in tech.

[Austen Allred] 12:28:09
But it very very prominent folks all over all came through trilogy.

[Austen Allred] 12:28:17
Excuse me. Is there anything specific we should download onto our computer before Monday? So the most important things are going to be Slack and Zoom.

[Austen Allred] 12:28:27
If you've already got those, then… Yeah, you should be all set.

[Austen Allred] 12:28:36
The… there's going to be some other software to download along the way, actually a decent amount of it, but we're going to cover all of that.

[Austen Allred] 12:28:46
Next week. So some of it, we won't install. I mean, there's stuff that you'll use that we won't touch until week seven, as an example.

[Austen Allred] 12:28:55
Can you tell more about the instruction team? Are they full-time instructors? What is their relevant experience, especially given the cutting edge nature?

[Austen Allred] 12:29:02
Yeah, so all the instructors work full time in AI and they're kind of taking time out of their day to come teach. The reason, actually, that's not true. There's one instructor who will be full time with us The reason we do it that way is because

[Austen Allred] 12:29:21
You can't that like finding people who have 18, we want them to be actually full-time builders, part-time teachers, as opposed to the inverse. We do believe you know i'm I've run different models and different methodologies.

[Austen Allred] 12:29:40
And then on top of that, we'll have a bunch of section leads and TAs. And those are folks who are less experienced, but they're very deeply Deep in AI.

[Austen Allred] 12:29:56
You know they're not you know, they're not like a PhD who's worked at Google for 10 years and now leads an AI team.

[Austen Allred] 12:30:03
But they've been working really hard with AI and most of them have been working with our corporate clients for the past year or so. So they've seen a whole lot. But yeah, yeah.

[Austen Allred] 12:30:19
I would not think of it as three instructors. Those are the first three that you're going to meet. They're going to be other come in and around 100-ish students. Yeah, that's directionally correct.

[Austen Allred] 12:30:31
12 weeks, yes. I've never made an app before. How much will you be instructing me and how much am I expecting to go figure out on your own? Yeah, if you've literally never built an app before.

[Austen Allred] 12:30:42
First week is going to be a doozy. The good thing is it's pretty easy to, you know, if you've written a little bit of code.

[Austen Allred] 12:30:53
To deploy apps now is not very hard. You can do it with Replit or you can have AI do most of the front work for you and deploy it on AWS pretty quickly.

[Austen Allred] 12:31:07
So yeah, there'll be a lot for you to figure out on your own. We don't We're not going to have a class where we say this is how you deploy an application. You're going to be doing that, asking AI what you need to do to deploy. We'll have people standing by and office hours to help you.

[Austen Allred] 12:31:23
But that's a really good example of stuff that You're just going to figure out on your own. And frankly, it's not that deploying an app that you've built is not that difficult so Especially now. Yeah.

[Austen Allred] 12:31:39
Is this all new curriculum similarly, is this related to Trilogy University CNU edition i so First, a disclaimer that Trilogy is a giant, giant company with all sorts of divisions. I don't know what the Trilogy University CNU edition is.

[Austen Allred] 12:31:57
So… were only related to Trilogy University in the sense that the people who built Trilogy University and the people who are behind Trilogy University are the ones defining the specs and the guidelines and the characteristics of how this should work.

[Austen Allred] 12:32:16
The curriculum is all new. Use some parts of the other Bloom programs that make sense. Like if it's introduction to RAG, we already have introduction to RAG. So we pulled that over.

[Austen Allred] 12:32:29
But the topics are actually pretty different. And they definitely don't follow the same flow. So it's pretty different.

[Austen Allred] 12:32:41
What are we expected to be able to do at this point? That's a really good question.

[Austen Allred] 12:32:47
Basically write a write You're expected to be able to learn really quickly and work really hard is the simplest way.

[Austen Allred] 12:32:56
I think everything else you can pick up along the way. That may be a really high bar if you've like If you've never built an app, as an example, you're going to have to figure out how to build an app.

[Austen Allred] 12:33:09
You learn that pretty quickly. So I'm not too worried about it.

[Austen Allred] 12:33:14
I have a conflict on one of the weekends. Is it unacceptable? You should email me details about that. Generally speaking, we say… don't miss anything. But obviously, you know, if.

[Austen Allred] 12:33:30
We'll look at it on a case-by-case basis.

[Austen Allred] 12:33:39
Curriculum has one week in each of the three projects in stage one. Austin's had one yeah so Any curriculum that you have seen should be considered subject to change.

[Austen Allred] 12:33:53
We had built out a plan for a really, really big four-week project.

[Austen Allred] 12:34:01
And the companies wanted us to compress that to cut off some of it and to put a couple different projects in.

[Austen Allred] 12:34:09
So, so yeah.

[Austen Allred] 12:34:15
Explain housing, please. What about pets or family? So this is, again, if you Have a pet or a family, shoot me an email. We've got a team that is working on The base expectation And I'm going to be very careful with my words here so that we don't

[Austen Allred] 12:34:36
Uh… confuse anybody, but then you know what to basically expect For accommodation, expect kind of hotel room style accommodation.

[Austen Allred] 12:34:48
We're still telling everybody to plan on dual occupancy unless you have a family or other extenuating circumstances that would require single occupancy.

[Austen Allred] 12:34:57
That's because we're still… frankly, negotiating with a couple of different spaces as to what it will look like. There is a chance that we end up everybody's single occupancy But… Yeah, you should think about it as hotel room style is the simplest way to describe it.

[Austen Allred] 12:35:18
And base case, plan on it being shared unless you have a family or other circumstances that Don't allow it to be shared. There is a decent chance that we just get, it ends up single occupancy for everybody, but I don't want to promise that.

[Austen Allred] 12:35:34
Because even in the case that that doesn't happen, I don't want it to be a surprise.

[Austen Allred] 12:35:40
So if you have a family that you are going to bring, shoot me an email. And we've got a team that's working on all of that.

[Austen Allred] 12:35:53
For folks who are invited, what would uninvite someone? I mean, you'd basically be uninvited if You're not doing the work or I mean, there will be people for whom they look at this and say, hey, this isn't a fit for me.

[Austen Allred] 12:36:08
That, you know, it's just… matter of fact. And if you're unable to figure out how to build stuff, then we'll have conversations along the way around, you know, is this what you really want to be doing.

[Austen Allred] 12:36:22
Or is this a fit? But I think for most people, if you're here.

[Austen Allred] 12:36:27
That means you're smart. And if you're willing to work hard, I think you can figure everything else out.

[Austen Allred] 12:36:34
Not everybody will want to. So that's how I would answer that question.

[Austen Allred] 12:36:42
Are we required to use a certain stack? No, not necessarily. We're going to give everybody AWS credentials because that's easiest.

[Austen Allred] 12:36:52
And most of the trilogy companies are very AWS-y. But there's no requirement around stack or languages. You can kind of build in whatever works for you.

[Austen Allred] 12:37:01
No.

[Austen Allred] 12:37:06
What should one expect for the in-person eight weeks? We're going to be collaborating, pair programming, meeting often.

[Austen Allred] 12:37:12
Yeah, I mean, we're going to, so there's going to be a living space and there's going to be a workspace. The vast majority of the time we're going to spend at the workspace.

[Austen Allred] 12:37:21
We're going to do a lot. In Austin. There'll be a lot more dinners and social events and we're going to go, you know.

[Austen Allred] 12:37:32
I'm not a big social events person, so I'm not the person creating all of those. But, you know, there's South by Southwest. We're in Austin. There'll be you know, some stuff that we all go do to hang out together

[Austen Allred] 12:37:47
It's not going to be there's not going to be a whole lot of group work because we want you to kind of, when you do too much group work in a program like this.

[Austen Allred] 12:37:58
It becomes a conflict of that person's working really hard and that person's trying to ride their coattails.

[Austen Allred] 12:38:03
So I have a little bit of group work toward the end.

[Austen Allred] 12:38:08
But um Yeah, well, most of it will be solo work.

[Austen Allred] 12:38:15
For the vast majority of the program.

[Austen Allred] 12:38:20
That's a really good question. The document measures success by a number of users. Do we need to get users in order to finish projects?

[Austen Allred] 12:38:30
We have changed that based on feedback from the company. So part of the project is going to be sharing it publicly.

[Austen Allred] 12:38:38
And asking public for feedback. But it became pretty clear when we ran kind of test runs of this that the people who had a big social following, it was really easy for them to get users and the people who didn't have a big social following, it wasn't as easy to get users.

[Austen Allred] 12:38:52
So it's still going to be a requirement that you share stuff, but we're not going to grade anything by number of users.

[Austen Allred] 12:38:59
And yeah, consider that an example of how this is our first run of doing anything like this. So everything is subject to change.

[Austen Allred] 12:39:10
And that one. We probably need to there's a 75% updated curriculum. This is, I think the curriculum you have is probably V4. V5 looks a little bit different, but…

[Austen Allred] 12:39:28
Yeah, and this is… Related to what I just said.

[Austen Allred] 12:39:33
I'll send you an updated version of the curriculum. Yes, week one will be building Slack.

[Austen Allred] 12:39:38
Week two, we'll be adding AI features to Slack.

[Austen Allred] 12:39:44
Really good question. Are we getting LLM credits? How does that work? Yeah, we're going to… give you API keys slash a lot of, so the programs have come together and Built one app called E4.

[Austen Allred] 12:40:01
That will introduce you to on Monday that basically lets you run a bunch of queries through a bunch of different models and see what all the outputs are and how different they are from each other. I told them that's an app they should sell because it's super, super valuable but

[Austen Allred] 12:40:16
Um the Yeah.

[Austen Allred] 12:40:20
Any LLM credits that you use, there'll be API keys for some There will be AWS access for some of the others. And then there's E4. So there's a whole There's a whole stream of work there, but yeah, we're going to cover all the LLM credits. What we don't know yet is OpenAI's 03 is currently in testing by

[Austen Allred] 12:40:44
What I call them research safety researchers. Once that becomes available, that's the one that we may have to limit credits on.

[Austen Allred] 12:40:53
Because you can run up a $5,000 bill in an afternoon on that. So we'll have to figure out what to do there.

[Austen Allred] 12:41:01
Yeah, really good question. Once we're in Austin, I assume there'll be a hotel. Yep, we talked about that. We're not going to work out of the hotel. There'll be a separate workspace.

[Austen Allred] 12:41:12
I'm not working out of the hotel. We'll be in-person instruction while in Austin or still Zoom. Generally speaking, still Zoom, just because we want to have the best instructor wherever they are.

[Austen Allred] 12:41:23
Then some people are flying to Austin. Some people have you know, if the best instructor we can find is somebody who's in San Francisco, we're going to have them do Zoom instruction via San Francisco.

[Austen Allred] 12:41:36
And then have people on the ground in Austin, as opposed to only accepting instructors who can be in Austin.

[Austen Allred] 12:41:48
We'll be installing monitoring software on our own devices. Yeah, it's a really good question. So the monitoring software that we're going to use is called WorkSmart.

[Austen Allred] 12:41:58
And we're using kind of using jerry-rigged version of it because it was originally built for hiring internationally. But what we're actually using it for now is So I'll tell you very bluntly from our end. We're monitoring it to see

[Austen Allred] 12:42:18
What AI apps and processes people are using for our own knowledge.

[Austen Allred] 12:42:25
And then you're going to be able to turn it on or off or put it on a user account that's gauntlet specific And only have it on when you're doing gauntlet specific stuff there. So we're not using it for anything

[Austen Allred] 12:42:40
Like normally Crossover built it to like Hey, are you billing the client during time that you're not working? Because people get mad at that. Obviously.

[Austen Allred] 12:42:49
You know, we're not paying anybody and all these roles are salaried regardless.

[Austen Allred] 12:42:55
But yeah, we're using it for our sakes to learn, to be totally blunt about it.

[Austen Allred] 12:43:01
Yeah.

[Austen Allred] 12:43:06
Why are the three sponsor companies anonymous? The only anonymous one is the one that's still in stealth.

[Austen Allred] 12:43:12
Because… the minute they say who they are, it will be obvious to the entire industry what's going on and they're not ready for that yet.

[Austen Allred] 12:43:25
What are the results of the last gauntlet class? This is the first one.

[Austen Allred] 12:43:31
Yeah. There are none.

[Austen Allred] 12:43:34
Who's going to own the production level apps we'll build once we've finished? Yeah, so the The way we've structured it tried to be as clean as possible.

[Austen Allred] 12:43:46
Is the wording is that the wording is Gauntlet will own IP required in order to learn from slash teach future people about.

[Austen Allred] 12:43:58
And any other IP you own. So basically, if we learn something from you and we want to teach it to somebody else in the future, we reserve the right to Yeah, it'd be impossible for us to say that we're not going to learn anything from watching you guys build stuff. So we own the IP from a

[Austen Allred] 12:44:16
From like an education standpoint. But you guys own all of the IP of everything that you build.

[Austen Allred] 12:44:23
I mean, we don't We don't want that. Obviously, you're going to be building the same apps as 100 other people so You know, the goal isn't to build anything that any of these companies are going to use or anything that's immediate. They may be monetizable. I don't really know

[Austen Allred] 12:44:41
Yeah, you guys can… keep all the apps. There is… A condition that if you join one of the companies after 100 days of working for one of the companies, if something you've built in Gauntlet is valuable.

[Austen Allred] 12:44:57
Then they'll ask for that to be transferred to them for IP. But I think that's going to be an edge case. They just want to and that's only if you join the company and Basically, if you build something that's really cool and you're not going to do anything with it, they'll want to try to do something with it.

[Austen Allred] 12:45:14
Optional.

[Austen Allred] 12:45:19
Are there any conditions to the offer or graduating? No, basically it's all going to be Are you… finishing the stuff that we're building and is it at a high enough standard?

[Austen Allred] 12:45:34
If it's not, then we, and I think there's another question a couple down What will leaving gauntlet look like? Yeah, we'll have a conversation. We'll say, hey, this isn't up to par.

[Austen Allred] 12:45:46
You need to be doing X, Y, Z. And eventually, if you're not able to get to that point, then we may ask you to leave. I don't want to pretend like that's not an option. But I will say it's going to be a mutual decision at that point. We're not just going to be

[Austen Allred] 12:46:04
Randomly, arbitrarily kicking people out.

[Austen Allred] 12:46:11
Are dogs welcome in housing accommodations? I don't know the answer to that. You should shoot me an email with details on The dog.

[Austen Allred] 12:46:22
I think we just answered that.

[Austen Allred] 12:46:29
What percentage of the hours would you say are during set times? Yeah, it's a really good question. So we'll have A lot of the lessons happen in the morning and a lot of the dinners happen at night.

[Austen Allred] 12:46:41
But if you wanted to, as an example. You know, if you want to sleep during the afternoon and then work at night, that's totally fine.

[Austen Allred] 12:46:53
So a lot of the, those are kind of the Think of like a lot of the morning hours will be lesson time. A lot of the evening hours will be social Not a lot of the evening hours, but the social activity and stuff like that and dinners and

[Austen Allred] 12:47:10
Guests that we bring in will be in the evening. A lot of the time outside of that is going to be your own. We are going to cover planning and making good use of your time and stuff like that but um

[Austen Allred] 12:47:23
Yeah.

[Austen Allred] 12:47:27
Will we be trained on how to use future AGI systems so we know how to best use them? Yeah, so… I'll leave aside the AGI.

[Austen Allred] 12:47:35
Part of that, we'll just talk about AI generally. A lot of what we're trying to teach everybody in Gauntlet to do is how to get to the cutting edge of AI and stay on the cutting edge of AI.

[Austen Allred] 12:47:47
And one of the reasons we have to work so hard is because AI is evolving so quickly that just staying on that cutting edge is going to be very difficult. And to be even more explicit about it.

[Austen Allred] 12:48:04
Openai just launched 03, which may change everything for us. It may change nothing. We don't know because we've only seen demos that OpenAI has put together so far.

[Austen Allred] 12:48:14
Um so Obviously, we're fighting to get access to that as soon as we can. I mean, I texted Sam about it while he was still doing the demo.

[Austen Allred] 12:48:23
That was probably one of 800 people to text him in real time but Yeah, a lot of what we're trying to do is make sure And I think this is a helpful framework. We're not trying to do cutting edge AI research or push the world of AI

[Austen Allred] 12:48:41
Dramatically forward because we think that's already happening at such a crazy pace by companies that are so well funded.

[Austen Allred] 12:48:49
That it's hard to contribute too terribly much to that. But what we want to do is be able to ride the wave.

[Austen Allred] 12:48:54
So no matter what happens, be able to, and, you know.

[Austen Allred] 12:49:00
The rate of innovation within AI is basically going straight vertical right now.

[Austen Allred] 12:49:04
Every week there's something new. And, you know, then we go talk to companies that feel like they're on the cutting edge of AI and they're a year behind So a lot of the purpose of Gauntlet is to get you to the cutting edge and teach you how to stay there.

[Austen Allred] 12:49:17
Because we think that that's going to be dramatically more valuable than being six months or a year behind, which is where the vast, vast majority of even the best companies are.

[Austen Allred] 12:49:29
So yeah, we'll be talking about that. A lot.

[Austen Allred] 12:49:37
I still have a job and would like to give two weeks notice. You should email me.

[Austen Allred] 12:49:45
We'll be working out of in Austin. That is still… There are a couple locations that we're looking at that depend on hotels and the hotels we're still going back and forth with.

[Austen Allred] 12:49:59
So, uh. I hate to say this, but TBD, it will be downtown-ish um not exactly in the heart of downtown We're not going to be like in Cedar park or you know too far out from the city. We want to stay somewhat close to the city.

[Austen Allred] 12:50:19
Any recommendations around front end stacks? Yeah, we'll be talking a lot about this.

[Austen Allred] 12:50:25
The… There are recommendations that we will make depending on what you're trying to do at different points in time.

[Austen Allred] 12:50:35
You know, some v0 stuff works really good. Some ReactI stuff works really well.

[Austen Allred] 12:50:42
There was a time when the models were far enough behind on And I don't know if this is where this question is coming from. Some of the models were behind enough on AI that people are getting a lot better results building kind of like with

[Austen Allred] 12:50:56
We'll call it 10 year old frameworks. So we're even like Ajax or stuff like that. That's no longer the case anymore.

[Austen Allred] 12:51:03
So it's more a matter of what's the best stack for what you're trying to do.

[Austen Allred] 12:51:08
I think we've answered that one. Minimum IQ. So the test we use is correlated with IQ. It's not directly an IQ test.

[Austen Allred] 12:51:19
I believe the cutoff was in the 96 or 97th percentile.

[Austen Allred] 12:51:24
So basically the top three or 4% was required to to make it this far.

[Austen Allred] 12:51:35
I think we talked about that. Yeah, it talks about that.

[Austen Allred] 12:51:43
Yeah, so what percentage of people do you expect to be invited to Austin slash pass the program?

[Austen Allred] 12:51:49
Originally, when we built it out, we were like, you know what?

[Austen Allred] 12:51:53
So first of all, my incentives and my bias, I get paid based on the number of people who graduate and get hired by the companies so It does not help me one bit for me for me to kick you guys out.

[Austen Allred] 12:52:09
So that, you know, should help calm some concerns. That said, the program is difficult. So originally we said, you know, I bet it's going to be 50% of people who get But then when we looked at how strict we're being in admissions, I anticipate it's more like 75, 80.

[Austen Allred] 12:52:25
And there are going to be a bunch of people who show up on week one and be like, oh, this is too hard. This isn't for me.

[Austen Allred] 12:52:31
Or whatever. But yeah, now I think it's probably 75, 80%. And it's going to be mostly self-selection out.

[Austen Allred] 12:52:41
I think pretty much if you're here and you're willing to learn really fast and work really hard, you'll be just fine.

[Austen Allred] 12:52:50
What kind of limits, licenses, requirements? Yeah. So yeah, like I said, you keep ownership of it.

[Austen Allred] 12:52:57
Obviously, if you're using, yeah, you keep ownership of it. I was going to talk about licenses generally.

[Austen Allred] 12:53:04
If… if you use somebody else's open source code, you have to, I mean, but that's obvious. You have to use licenses that allow you to sell stuff if you want to sell it.

[Austen Allred] 12:53:16
You own ownership. There's a… there's an aspect of dual ownership where if we learn something from you, we want to be able to teach that to other people.

[Austen Allred] 12:53:26
But you own the code, you own the products. And then if you work for the company and they want to utilize it after 100 days of your employment.

[Austen Allred] 12:53:36
Then the ownership would transfer to them at that point. I think we answered this one.

[Austen Allred] 12:53:45
I think it's probably going to end up single occupancy, but plan on dual occupancy and forget that I said anything about single occupancy.

[Austen Allred] 12:53:51
And it will be a happy surprise if that's the case.

[Austen Allred] 12:53:57
I think we've done that. I will say um the

[Austen Allred] 12:54:05
The part of this that I do want to answer is that um is that during the online portion, there's less focus on social activities.

[Austen Allred] 12:54:18
Than there is in the Austin portion for obvious reasons, I would imagine

[Austen Allred] 12:54:27
Yeah, if you have experience training LLMs, will that be of any advantage? I think that will be of some advantage, like even knowing how LLMs work will be an advantage.

[Austen Allred] 12:54:35
We're not going to be training LLMs for the most part in anything that we do.

[Austen Allred] 12:54:41
But I think knowing knowing how a transformer works as an example, knowing how weights work will will be helpful.

[Austen Allred] 12:54:52
Will it be contractors or permanent employees? I think all the roles are permanent full-time W-2 employees.

[Austen Allred] 12:55:03
Talked about this. Talk about laptops.

[Austen Allred] 12:55:09
Will there be any restrictions on sharing to social media some of what we learned or what the experience is like?

[Austen Allred] 12:55:15
No, we hope that you… Share.

[Austen Allred] 12:55:19
The more you share, the better. In fact, we're going to require you to share some parts.

[Austen Allred] 12:55:25
Yeah.

[Austen Allred] 12:55:29
Thank you for that. Lucas.

[Austen Allred] 12:55:34
Roles will be full-time true full-time salaried roles.

[Austen Allred] 12:55:41
Yep. Yep, we talked about IP in depth.

[Austen Allred] 12:55:49
We'll use any previous skills in the new job. I mean, I'm sure some of you will. I mean, we've talked to a couple people who are, as an example.

[Austen Allred] 12:55:57
Hey, I'm an expert in computer vision. The education companies are trying to build computer vision stuff right now. That would… be beneficial and useful.

[Austen Allred] 12:56:09
And there are going to be people that they just are going to be really good at building apps so The answer is if you have previous skills that's never That's always useful. Obviously, there's not a guarantee that what you've studied in the past will be exactly what you work on in the future.

[Austen Allred] 12:56:26
But yeah, we, you know, well, when we get into the matching process, we want to know about that and take it into consideration and Yeah.

[Austen Allred] 12:56:36
I think we answered that. Are we competitive with each other or is this more competitive? I think what you're saying is like.

[Austen Allred] 12:56:45
So we will have um leaderboards and stuff like that but that's More just because it's fun.

[Austen Allred] 12:56:53
Or, you know, houses, kind of Harry Potter style, that kind of thing.

[Austen Allred] 12:56:57
But it's not… the closest analogy is like, it's not like golf where there's a cut line and we're taking the top And it's, you know, we would If everybody in This room does really, really well. We'd be glad to have everybody succeed and hire everybody on the other side. That's fantastic.

[Austen Allred] 12:57:19
I think we answered that. I think we answered that. Use whatever you want for front end back end Besides of projects, what will the coursework look like?

[Austen Allred] 12:57:30
Is there an expected list of resources, video homework. Yeah, so we're going to have live lessons and then there's going to be other stuff that We just have a bunch of resources that we share. I think one of the things that's unique about the way that we view the world

[Austen Allred] 12:57:46
There's stuff that, you know, we're doing our absolute best to put together a curriculum of what is on the cutting edge.

[Austen Allred] 12:57:54
But we are totally aware that there's going to be stuff that we see or that you see that we have never thought of or heard about. And it would be, you know.

[Austen Allred] 12:58:04
If we were teaching you physics, it's like, yeah, everything in physics has been static for at the basic levels of physics has been static for 50 years. We have all the resources that you'll need.

[Austen Allred] 12:58:17
There will be times where we stumble upon stuff and we say, oh, wow, that's really interesting. We've even talked to a couple people about you know, hey, if we haven't seen the courses yet, but people that we know and respect that are working on their own courses.

[Austen Allred] 12:58:32
Can we just buy a license for everybody? So we're not going to be exclusive to everything that you have to do is going to be created and owned by Gauntlet AI. Obviously we're doing All of that to the extent possible. But if you stumble upon something that's valuable that doesn't live within our wheelhouse or our world or within our IP,

[Austen Allred] 12:58:54
We're not opposed to using that and we're going to try to figure out the best way to get it to everybody.

[Austen Allred] 12:58:59
So yeah.

[Austen Allred] 12:59:07
Oh, shoot. Wrong button.

[Austen Allred] 12:59:12
I've been building stuff with AI elements since 2019. I've been coding professionally for eight years. So yeah, this is… This is something we hear.

[Austen Allred] 12:59:24
A lot is, hey, I've been on the cutting edge of this even when we do training with corporate clients. There's always like, hey, I've done a lot of this stuff.

[Austen Allred] 12:59:32
I would bet my house that there's going to be stuff that we go over that you haven't seen before or that you haven't learned as to whether that's worth enough for you to take 12 weeks away from your startup. That's a decision you've got to make.

[Austen Allred] 12:59:49
But I think everybody that comes out of this is going to be in the 99th percentile of AI usage and of being able to leverage these tools. So you've got to decide if that's worth it for you.

[Austen Allred] 13:00:06
Yep. Like we said, we changed that, so ignore that.

[Austen Allred] 13:00:13
If you don't have a working laptop at the moment, email me.

[Austen Allred] 13:00:17
We'll figure it out. Laptops are that if a laptop is at any point the thing that's holding you back from being successful, please let me know.

[Austen Allred] 13:00:27
An easy problem to solve.

[Austen Allred] 13:00:33
Is the first at-home portion as intense as the in Austin portion? I think it might be slightly more intense, actually, because there's no Or there's less of a social hangout, get to know each other aspect.

[Austen Allred] 13:00:46
Not that we don't want you to hang out in the virtual version.

[Austen Allred] 13:00:51
But it's harder remote. So we're saving a lot of that for when we're all in Austin.

[Austen Allred] 13:00:56
I have not yet moved to Austin. I moved moved to Austin in a couple of weeks so i'll meet you all out there.

[Austen Allred] 13:01:05
We'll be training around understanding the effective ways to apply AI? Yes, absolutely.

[Austen Allred] 13:01:12
The purpose of what we do is not Basically, you can think of 100% of what we're trying to do is build stuff by applying AI in the best way possible.

[Austen Allred] 13:01:26
Well, let's see. Yeah, be able to diagnose business efficiencies and propose solutions Or just, I mean, all of the above.

[Austen Allred] 13:01:35
Yeah. Do you have a specific location? I think we've talked about that.

[Austen Allred] 13:01:43
More detail on the week one project. No, you're going to be building.

[Austen Allred] 13:01:48
You're not just building a building you're like, you're Think of it as rebuilding Slack.

[Austen Allred] 13:01:56
Obviously, you're not going to get all the features that Slack has built. But all the enterprise-y single sign-on-y stuff we won't have but The closer you can get to the core functionality of the way Slack actually works today, the happier

[Austen Allred] 13:02:14
You'll be and will be. It's 200k the total comp, including bonus. It's 200k base And that is just a, that's a starting point.

[Austen Allred] 13:02:26
So as an example, within Trilogy Ventures. They're going to be people for whom the job is kind of starting a new company within Trilogy and building a new app.

[Austen Allred] 13:02:38
And they're going to be people who are in Gauntlet today that a year from now are making a million dollars a year.

[Austen Allred] 13:02:44
It's not going to be the base case. It's not going to be the median, but… 200K is the starting point for everybody. And that's salary only benefits are on top of that.

[Austen Allred] 13:02:56
Any bonus would be on 200k base. Yep. And by the way, if you're in Austin, there's no income tax.

[Austen Allred] 13:03:05
And coming from the Bay Area to Utah to Austin. Austin is about half the price of Utah, which is about half the price of the Bay Area. So 200K goes a really long way.

[Austen Allred] 13:03:20
Do any, oh, shoot. To any of the companies use Azure, I'm not totally sure. I think most of Trilogy is pretty AWS-y That said, they're buying companies, so I'm sure some of the companies are using Azure.

[Austen Allred] 13:03:37
All right. Can the program be done remotely? First four weeks are entirely remote. The second eight weeks are entirely in person. There's not an option to do the entire thing remote.

[Austen Allred] 13:03:49
Answered that.

[Austen Allred] 13:03:56
Yeah, how are you going to keep people safe from infection? We're just going to be smart about it. We're not going to do rigorous testing or anything like that If you're sick, then obviously we'll have accommodations for you where you can stay home

[Austen Allred] 13:04:12
Meaning in your in your hotel room But we'll figure all that out, but we're not going to do anything too terribly crazy or novel.

[Austen Allred] 13:04:23
How can I best prepare for the next week? Yeah, so if you've been building apps for a long time, a lot of week one is going to be prompting an AI-first development.

[Austen Allred] 13:04:37
I mean… If you want to get a head start, you can so the The way that we… All of your code should be output by AI first.

[Austen Allred] 13:04:50
We're really not going to be writing any code by hand pretty much ever.

[Austen Allred] 13:04:56
Wrap your mind around building Slack where that's the case. How do you do that on the front end? How do you do that on the back end. Yeah.

[Austen Allred] 13:05:07
Can we provide our own accommodations if we prefer not to share a room for the eight weeks? Yeah, for sure.

[Austen Allred] 13:05:12
That's totally fine. I… would say, wait until we know if you have to before you do anything.

[Austen Allred] 13:05:20
But yeah, it's fine.

[Austen Allred] 13:05:27
Yeah, everything. Not necessarily.

[Austen Allred] 13:05:31
So ownership of everything we build during Gauntlet reverts to our employer after 100 days, correct?

[Austen Allred] 13:05:37
Why is that? That's really only anything if the company wants to take something that you're building and they want to have you build it out.

[Austen Allred] 13:05:47
For things we build in Teams, it doesn't really apply. You just own the IP for that.

[Austen Allred] 13:05:54
Do I have to be social? I feel your pain. I'm not a very big social person as well. But what I will say is it's very different being social when you're all working on the same stuff together.

[Austen Allred] 13:06:07
And have the same goals and it'll be fun. I'd say that as a semi antisocial person. So I'm looking forward to it.

[Austen Allred] 13:06:16
Do you have a rough idea of how many over 40s there are in the program?

[Austen Allred] 13:06:21
I don't know that off the top of my head. I know there are a handful.

[Austen Allred] 13:06:26
I haven't looked too closely at any of the demographic info, so I don't know that off the top of my head. I don't want to guess and be wrong.

[Austen Allred] 13:06:33
But I know they're are a few.

[Austen Allred] 13:06:40
This is a really good question. Do you expect us to be able to name drop Gauntlet in the tech world so You'll see this in the handbook that we send out.

[Austen Allred] 13:06:52
One of our goals is to for Gauntlet to be a better credential than saying you graduated from Stanford or MIT or something like that.

[Austen Allred] 13:07:04
So that is… Yeah, that's very, very explicitly our goal is for you to be able to say, hey, I went to Gauntlet and people go, oh, wow.

[Austen Allred] 13:07:18
Isn't, I mean, it's actually starting to happen It became a thing with Trilogy in the 90s where people would just, you know, if you added Trilogy University to your bio on LinkedIn. And this is before linkedin but you know

[Austen Allred] 13:07:33
People heard through the grapevine that you went to Trilogy University. They would just try to hire you cold.

[Austen Allred] 13:07:39
And pull you away from Trilogy University. I don't think we have to worry about that too much yet, but I've definitely had a bunch of people saying.

[Austen Allred] 13:07:47
Hey, can I hire the gauntlet grads? I'm like, no, we've got, we won't have enough gauntlet grads for the sponsoring companies, let alone for everybody else.

[Austen Allred] 13:07:55
But I anticipate that in the future, being able to say you're a gauntlet grad That's what we're working towards is a really, really valuable credential.

[Austen Allred] 13:08:07
What do you see the appeal of Gauntlet being for a very social extroverted person, personable student? I mean, I think That stuff bodes well.

[Austen Allred] 13:08:16
In most any role that you do. Yeah, but I don't know… Any specific answer to that for like, oh, that role, if you're really extroverted is the right role. I look at it as, you know, if you're really good with people and you're really, really good with AI, that's a

[Austen Allred] 13:08:36
Killer dual threat.

[Austen Allred] 13:08:42
Would a US citizen be able to get a job offer to work in the EU or UK if they prefer that over staying in the US?

[Austen Allred] 13:08:48
I don't know how the immigration statuses of the companies that are in Europe.

[Austen Allred] 13:08:52
So those of you that are… Curious.

[Austen Allred] 13:08:59
We are accepting a handful of people from Europe because one of the companies has European arm Where they want to have a few people that are working in Europe and they're flying them into Austin. This person is asking if I'm in the US, can I go work over there?

[Austen Allred] 13:09:11
I don't know enough about the immigration laws and policies to be able to answer that.

[Austen Allred] 13:09:17
But we can look at if that's an option. As we go along. I don't know enough to say.

[Austen Allred] 13:09:27
The current AI-related openings on Crossover offer $50 an hour. So there are some AI related openings on Crossover that offer $50 an hour.

[Austen Allred] 13:09:38
That is pretty unrelated to what we're doing. If you can

[Austen Allred] 13:09:48
If you can do very basic prompting, they'll hire basically anybody on the planet for $50 an hour. This is much more than that.

[Austen Allred] 13:09:56
If you got into this program, you could earn that $50 an hour from Crossover. My assumption is you wouldn't want to.

[Austen Allred] 13:10:03
Yeah, that's a completely different role.

[Austen Allred] 13:10:09
Any advice on how to use future AGI systems? I mean, the entirety of what we're doing is all about how to stay on the cutting edge of AI.

[Austen Allred] 13:10:17
What AGI means, I'm not totally sure of. When something becomes AGI, I'm not totally sure of, but If it ever does… become real or if we're already there, I don't know, then yeah, you should be able to be on the cutting edge of that.

[Austen Allred] 13:10:33
One of the main goals. I have access to O3 Mini. It's free for safety testing right now. Yeah, I was trying to figure out how to

[Austen Allred] 13:10:45
How to, without lying, get access to it and say that we're doing safety research, but you can't. We're not.

[Austen Allred] 13:10:53
$15. I mean, if it's at that price, then yeah, we will be totally fine.

[Austen Allred] 13:11:00
That's great.

[Austen Allred] 13:11:06
Can we get help from outside resources? Sure. Yeah, we're going to encourage you to be public and asking experts for stuff and asking Yeah, we're not.

[Austen Allred] 13:11:18
We're not insular at all. Do you know how many of the engineers you've trained for Trilogy are still employed by them? I don't know that number.

[Austen Allred] 13:11:28
I'd imagine it's most. If not, you know, very close to all.

[Austen Allred] 13:11:35
But that's not a number I've asked about. The first thing is a Zoom meeting. On Monday, one of the I guess if you're here, Joe Lamont, you can Google him and find him.

[Austen Allred] 13:11:52
It's kind of annoying to him that one of the first things that pops up is the Forbes list of how much money he has. It's like, that's not what I want to be known for. He tries to stay very below the radar, but he's going to

[Austen Allred] 13:12:04
He's created, he's the founder of Trilogy. I started Trilogy University. He's going to be joining us on Monday.

[Austen Allred] 13:12:09
And then we're going to go over a lot of logistical stuff on Monday. And then we're going to have our first, so Monday is going to be a little bit of a slog. Then we're going to have our first Introduction to prompting, and then we're going to start building on Monday.

[Austen Allred] 13:12:23
So it'll be… It'll be wild.

[Austen Allred] 13:12:31
What do you think the impact of growing widespread AI-assisted software development on society will be? I mean, this is a There are a million different directions you could go with this. The short-term version of what I see is the people who can use AI

[Austen Allred] 13:12:45
Become extremely valuable. And the people who don't use AI start to look like you know if you like i i It feels similar to like the 90s There's like a break between people who built stuff for like internet stuff and people who just stayed building on mainframes and whatever else

[Austen Allred] 13:13:09
I think it will be super, super valuable if you know how to use AI. And if you don't, then I think Eventually, it'll probably take a decade, but eventually we get to a point where being able to code without using AI will be

[Austen Allred] 13:13:22
Pretty worthless. It may take five years, may take a decade. But yeah, I think there's going to be haves and have nots in the same way that has happened in every other technical revolution that's happened.

[Austen Allred] 13:13:33
The people who adapt quickly are richly rewarded and then The people who don't, it becomes an issue that we all have to reckon with at some point. But yeah.

[Austen Allred] 13:13:46
If you only clock 40 hours a week in the time tracker and didn't do more than average, you may not get a job. I wouldn't say that necessarily I would say if you can do more than the average in 40 hours a week, I'll be shocked.

[Austen Allred] 13:13:59
Because a lot of people are going to be working really, really hard.

[Austen Allred] 13:14:04
You know, the time isn't measure that we look at to determine whether you are doing what you need to be doing. The time is an expectation that we want to share with all of you of what we think will be required in order to get

[Austen Allred] 13:14:23
All of the stuff done and to learn as much as you need to learn. So we're not going to be sitting there saying, oh, this guy worked X, he's out. This guy worked Y, he's in. It's going to be more based on the results, but

[Austen Allred] 13:14:38
If everybody joined anticipating 40 hours a week and the people who do 40 hours aren't successful, then that's a failure on my part so We want to prepare your expectations appropriately.

[Austen Allred] 13:14:54
Is a capstone project a team project? Like I said, we were rebuilding that as we speak so um I'll give you more of that.

[Austen Allred] 13:15:06
Do the companies have the option to not hire any of us even if we complete the program? No.

[Austen Allred] 13:15:11
If you complete the program, you are You are guaranteed a role.

[Austen Allred] 13:15:22
Can we refuse to hand over the rights for what we built to the employer? Would there be any consequence for that? Yeah, you can I mean, you can have that conversation.

[Austen Allred] 13:15:32
I mean, if you really want to go build your own thing, there's no penalty for not joining the employer, you should just go build your own thing.

[Austen Allred] 13:15:42
The reason… that they want to retain the rights if you stay I mean, the trilogy Ventures arm, if you have something that you're really passionate about.

[Austen Allred] 13:15:52
They would love to hire you and have you build that And they… the way it works, and I'll let them explain more is basically the goal is to get it to a million in ARR as quickly as possible And as soon as you get it to a million in ARR, your salary goes to a million a year.

[Austen Allred] 13:16:12
So I think for most of you, that's probably a better path.

[Austen Allred] 13:16:15
But yeah, if you're not working at the employer, you don't have to hand anything over. So you're totally good.

[Austen Allred] 13:16:24
You mentioned gratings. How are those grades used? Is it mostly feedback to help facilitate learning? Yes, that's mostly what it is There are going to be times when, hey, what you're building isn't up to snuff and we need to have a conversation about it.

[Austen Allred] 13:16:38
And grading is one of the mechanisms that By which you will learn about that.

[Austen Allred] 13:16:43
So yeah. What's a path after gauntlet to making more than 200K, like a million? What's your advice for continuing leveling up skills and comp? I mean.

[Austen Allred] 13:16:54
A lot of what we're going to talk about is going to be staying on the cutting edge.

[Austen Allred] 13:17:02
Everything. And then I think the very simple answer i know Trilogy as an example, pays a lot of people a million dollars a year.

[Austen Allred] 13:17:12
And they would love to pay more people a million dollars a year if you can deliver more than a million dollars in value and show that So Trilogy Like they have a capital deployment problem where they have more money than you or I can imagine. And they're trying to find ways to turn that money into more value as quickly as possible.

[Austen Allred] 13:17:32
So if you can help them in doing that, you get paid in accordance with doing that.

[Austen Allred] 13:17:44
Personally, what has it been like for you to be so close to the heart of AI creating Gauntlet

[Austen Allred] 13:17:51
Really fun. At times a little bit scary. I mean, I haven't seen, you know, like, oh, this is AGI. I haven't seen anything that, you know, isn't public.

[Austen Allred] 13:18:04
But there are times when I look at something and I go, oh, wow. And it takes like… There's a book by some guy, I can't remember the name of, where he talks about like, there's usually three sleepless nights when you start getting into AI where you realize, oh.

[Austen Allred] 13:18:19
That changes this and that will that change will, you know, the cascade of all those changes happening is pretty crazy. And a lot of the times it's exciting.

[Austen Allred] 13:18:29
One of the reasons I'm excited for Gauntlet And I'm like.

[Austen Allred] 13:18:35
You know, if you're I get why there are people that say, hey, you know, this is not the right program for me right now.

[Austen Allred] 13:18:43
Yeah, totally understand that. But I'm like, man, if you just saw what we're all seeing within Trilogy, you would be Doing anything you can to get to the cutting edge of all this stuff as fast as you can, because it is the future and the amount of value you can create is wild. I'm sure you've all seen

[Austen Allred] 13:19:01
Small demos of stuff on X or whatever else but Imagine that at scale in an enterprise environment. And it's like, oh.

[Austen Allred] 13:19:12
That's a fun… life starts to look fundamentally different Once you're on the cutting edge of AI. And that's the reason Gauntlet exists. And that's why we want to get you all there.

[Austen Allred] 13:19:24
So, yeah. Yeah, so this is a really good question.

[Austen Allred] 13:19:31
The companies that feel like they're on the cutting edge of AI but are not They're not looking in the right places. They're looking at like What is Microsoft telling me the cutting edge of AI is they're not looking at like, who are the individual builders

[Austen Allred] 13:19:47
And honestly, most of it is research papers and a lot of it's on X.

[Austen Allred] 13:19:52
Is where you find a lot of the most cutting edge stuff that has become the de facto

[Austen Allred] 13:20:02
The de facto place where stuff happens. So it's usually, I think if you're looking to stay on the cutting edge actively.

[Austen Allred] 13:20:09
And not just going to Microsoft and saying, what's the cutting edge, then you will know.

[Austen Allred] 13:20:15
And we'll talk a lot about how to, you know, we've got Twitter lists that, sorry, X lists that we all watch and we'll share and Second brain slash brain lifts that we'll all be building together where we talk very explicitly about

[Austen Allred] 13:20:28
What's the best way to stay on the cutting edge? So you should know.

[Austen Allred] 13:20:37
Do I get to bring my desktop and multi-monitors to the workspace area? If you want to, for sure.

[Austen Allred] 13:20:42
No problem with that. This is a really interesting question.

[Austen Allred] 13:20:49
Full disclosure, can you share how much of investment the companies are making in this cohort of gauntlets specifically?

[Austen Allred] 13:20:57
So I don't know. I don't have access to all their financials.

[Austen Allred] 13:21:02
I know that for the housing portion alone. It was between a million and 2 million.

[Austen Allred] 13:21:10
For the training portion, it's several million. And we were talking about like Will people realize that this is for real?

[Austen Allred] 13:21:21
You know, the CIO of Trilogy, who you'll get to meet at some point, was like.

[Austen Allred] 13:21:26
Can I just like move a few hundred million into a bank account and say, this is what we've reserved for the hiring of all these people?

[Austen Allred] 13:21:34
Because it's one thing to… Like they're going to spend millions in flying everybody out, housing everybody, feeding everybody.

[Austen Allred] 13:21:44
But then after that, you know, they want to hire hundreds of people at 200,000 a year. So you're into the hundreds of millions just like that.

[Austen Allred] 13:21:55
And we're not going to be able to get there for them. They're not spending as much as they would like.

[Austen Allred] 13:22:00
Because we had to be so strict in admissions. But yeah, they're I mean, across… That and the funding that has gone into the it's Probably close, I mean, not for this cohort specifically But I would guess in the next 12 months, we're starting to touch the billions mark.

[Austen Allred] 13:22:21
So yeah, it's a I mean, the reason it seems… too good to be true at times is because normally companies are not like, hey, let's put a billion dollars into this new initiative.

[Austen Allred] 13:22:34
These guys… throw nine figures at stuff that they're serious about and this is they're very serious about.

[Austen Allred] 13:22:43
If we can survive week one to two, is it likely we'll survive the rest? I think so. I mean, I think if you're Yeah, there's always… going to be questions, et cetera, et cetera.

[Austen Allred] 13:22:56
Um but Yeah, I think… I think so.

[Austen Allred] 13:23:02
I'm not… I'm not totally sure what challenges will come up.

[Austen Allred] 13:23:06
But yeah. I assume part of the travel will be you know transportation to the hotel etc Yeah, so… Another really good question. Yes, we'll cover, we're deciding whether it's best to And, you know, not to go too deep into the weeds of the different options but um

[Austen Allred] 13:23:30
One of the areas is walkable, but not as nice of accommodations. Another one is nicer accommodations, but would require shuttle or uber credits or something like that. But yeah, the assumption from the companies is that They'll cover everything that you need. Now, if you say, hey, I'm going to go out

[Austen Allred] 13:23:50
You know, partying on my own. Obviously, they're not going to cover that There will be times, and I should be clear that There will be times when alcohol is available and offered. I'm not a drinker myself.

[Austen Allred] 13:24:04
Um but It will be available for folks. So when it's gauntlet provided, gauntlet is covering it.

[Austen Allred] 13:24:13
When it's not, it's not.

[Austen Allred] 13:24:18
Are there any concerns with integrity and work sharing? Yeah, we talk about that and we think about that. I think it's going to be pretty obvious. I mean, you're going to submit your code.

[Austen Allred] 13:24:28
You're going to share your work. Um so Yeah, unless someone is like writing code for you, which doesn't make any sense because it's easier to get the AI to write the code for you than a person.

[Austen Allred] 13:24:41
I'm not too concerned about it. But there is… I mean, you are going to sign a form that says basically, I agree.

[Austen Allred] 13:24:50
To not use other people's work and You know, very basic stuff like that. And that I didn't cheat on the entrance exams coming in.

[Austen Allred] 13:24:59
If you're not comfortable signing that, then you should not sign that and you should not join.

[Austen Allred] 13:25:03
But yeah. All right. And if you need to jump, feel free to jump. I see we've still got 34 questions.

[Austen Allred] 13:25:13
I'll be here until we've gotten through all of them.

[Austen Allred] 13:25:18
Is there any guarantee for how long the companies will employ us?

[Austen Allred] 13:25:23
I mean, there's not a… I can't think of a way to guarantee that like if If you stop showing up to work, then yeah, they're going to fire you.

[Austen Allred] 13:25:34
But there is not… Yeah, so I don't know how to guarantee that.

[Austen Allred] 13:25:40
But no, they want to… hire as many people as they can.

[Austen Allred] 13:25:46
Yeah, it's a totally fair question. Um… What do you mean you're going to require us to share some parts on social media? I mean, part of your assignment will be posting on X, this is what I've built and this is how it works.

[Austen Allred] 13:26:02
Specifically. Video walkthrough of video walkthrough of what you're building.

[Austen Allred] 13:26:12
What's the admin breakdown so we have an idea of our classmates. This looks like it's mostly for people who never went to college.

[Austen Allred] 13:26:19
No, it's, I mean… Again, I'm going to do this without having like done a statistical analysis of Everything. I know there are a couple questions that folks asked along the way that were answered.

[Austen Allred] 13:26:36
Um so Somebody had asked… what percentage of the people went to a top university of the gauntlet grads? Let me see if I can find it real quick so I don't misquote anything.

[Austen Allred] 13:26:54
And this was as December 26th. So top university being ranked 1 to 15 in their respective country The number was 23%.

[Austen Allred] 13:27:07
They have a metric in crossover for a high achieving high school student meaning They were a member of NHS or a beta club or a similar academic club National Merit Scholar or other academic honor attended an elite high school or had notable projects pre-university. They use AI to determine that.

[Austen Allred] 13:27:26
17.5% appeared to be high achieving high school student. Obviously, that's based on like what's available in LinkedIn and your CV. And a fourth of the people didn't have anything in their LinkedIn or CV.

[Austen Allred] 13:27:43
So there is that. But I think… you would expect, if you were to take a sampling of the top 5% of intelligence from the US, it's going to look pretty similar to that.

[Austen Allred] 13:27:58
So it's not mostly for people who never went to college My assumption is most people are going to have graduated from college. That said, not everybody for sure.

[Austen Allred] 13:28:09
This is interesting. Is it true that Ilya Suskegevor applied to gauntlet AI but was rejected because he failed the coding test?

[Austen Allred] 13:28:16
I have not heard that. That would be kind of hilarious. I highly doubt it.

[Austen Allred] 13:28:22
Let me look real quick. I can… No, there's no way.

[Austen Allred] 13:28:34
Oh, yeah. What am I report? My assumption is… No, if you know where that came from… Hell yeah.

[Austen Allred] 13:28:48
I don't see an application for him. Maybe that was a joke. I don't know.

[Austen Allred] 13:28:54
Let me know. When you say building apps, you mean web apps, mobile, desktop. Yeah.

[Austen Allred] 13:29:03
There'll be web and mobile apps. I don't think we do anything desktop specific.

[Austen Allred] 13:29:08
Because, you know, you can… maybe use a progressive web app that's downloadable if you want to but yeah If too many people are leaving, will the difficulty of the program be adjusted? No.

[Austen Allred] 13:29:25
Can you please elaborate on the requirement around installing monitoring software on our personal devices?

[Austen Allred] 13:29:30
Yeah, so we'll send out some information on this there's a program called Work Smart that everybody's going to put on their personal devices.

[Austen Allred] 13:29:39
You can either, so it turns on and off. So you have to like literally go in and click a button and say, begin monitoring. It takes four screenshots every 60 minutes, I believe.

[Austen Allred] 13:29:53
And it's basically just watching how you're using AI and stuff like that.

[Austen Allred] 13:30:00
And you can either, I mean, if you want to what some people are doing is they're creating a new like role or a new user on their machine and they're just installing the software on that.

[Austen Allred] 13:30:17
Role. So you can do that, but it's really not necessary because you can turn it off or delete it at any time.

[Austen Allred] 13:30:24
So yeah, it basically it watches the way they're using AI.

[Austen Allred] 13:30:31
And we want to be like transparent that we are going to be trying to use that to learn if there are any AI techniques or practices that that we should know about and share with people. There's some AI stuff

[Austen Allred] 13:30:47
On the back end that watches that. Yeah, that's pretty much it.

[Austen Allred] 13:30:58
Any more details to come about Monday? Yeah, we're sending a bunch of stuff out as soon as I'm done with this webinar and can finish getting AI to to type out the rest of it but we've got the And yeah, well, actually what I'm really doing battle with is Google Apps because I'm trying to add everybody to

[Austen Allred] 13:31:16
Get their email account created and Google Apps is… confused about something um so yeah

[Austen Allred] 13:31:26
How can we help you improve and grow Gauntlet beyond working hard on the course material? I love that question.

[Austen Allred] 13:31:32
I think, you know, obviously the initial starting point is going to be if you all become really good employees and do a really good job.

[Austen Allred] 13:31:39
Beyond that, you know, if you… send more people to us for the next cohorts, assuming there will be more cohorts.

[Austen Allred] 13:31:48
Whether or not there will be cohorts is going to be dependent upon how well we do.

[Austen Allred] 13:31:53
Yeah, that would be the most helpful thing.

[Austen Allred] 13:31:59
Yeah, I actually sent an email to the logistics team asking about this. I assume we're going to get some sort of monitors in I think that's the safest. I haven't heard back on that, but if not, we'll figure it out.

[Austen Allred] 13:32:13
Yeah, you don't want to be sitting there doing everything on your laptop so

[Austen Allred] 13:32:20
If you get stuck during the first four weeks and don't find the solution in chat, are we able to ask each other for help?

[Austen Allred] 13:32:24
Yeah, you can totally ask each other for help.

[Austen Allred] 13:32:31
Do we have to commit by tonight or tomorrow night? By tomorrow night.

[Austen Allred] 13:32:37
I've never been to Austin. Any comment on the scene, weather, things to do aside from what I'm assuming is amazing barbecue. There is indeed amazing barbecue.

[Austen Allred] 13:32:45
There's a really fun, like it's a small downtown. Like don't envision new york It's like a downtown that if there's traffic, it takes an extra 10 minutes to drive through.

[Austen Allred] 13:32:58
Uh… The downtown scene, I mean, it's fun. There's University of… Texas there in Austin. So there's a lot of young folks The weather is… warm. It gets… some would say hot in the summer gets in the 90s and 100s. It should be pretty great weather the entire time that we're there.

[Austen Allred] 13:33:19
Looking forward to that. And we'll definitely be sampling different aspects of the Austin barbecue And because I had a couple questions about that, yeah, they're vegetarian options and If you have dietary restrictions, let us know. And there's, yeah, we'll

[Austen Allred] 13:33:36
Options for all of that. Do you envision not having a public social presence being a problem for the program. It won't be a problem like that you don't have a lot of followers, but we will literally require you to share stuff on X, even if it's two zero followers.

[Austen Allred] 13:33:53
So yeah, start our next profile. And I don't care whether it's anonymous or whether it's clearly, I don't really care. But yeah, you'll be needing to share stuff on x and Like, I will say… all of the cutting edge stuff is happening first on X. And if you have questions, X is a really great place to

[Austen Allred] 13:34:14
Learn more about stuff.

[Austen Allred] 13:34:21
You can start in a base on the doc that's already been shared, but what we're going to share shortly is a lot more I think we talked about Trilogy Ventures. They're definitely going to want to hire people to go build companies. So if you're interested in that.

[Austen Allred] 13:34:38
A lot of snow along the way.

[Austen Allred] 13:34:43
Yeah, I probably shouldn't have said anything about the Slack clone. We are going to build a Slack clone.

[Austen Allred] 13:34:47
But you're going to Yeah, regret having started early.

[Austen Allred] 13:34:53
All of the code output has to be AI first. So you're not writing any of the code yourself.

[Austen Allred] 13:34:59
Ai is writing all of the code. If you can do that well enough to start, then sure, go ahead and get a head start. I'm not going to encourage that because I think I would probably prefer that you didn't, but I'm you know

[Austen Allred] 13:35:13
I can't stop you.

[Austen Allred] 13:35:19
I think we answered that. We'll be lessons on the weekends. Nothing… Nothing planned.

[Austen Allred] 13:35:30
One thing that you'll notice is

[Austen Allred] 13:35:35
They are they're going to be they're going to be impromptu lessons here or there where we stumble upon something and then have our team go in and say, oh, what's happening? Oh, wow, that's crazy. We need to show that to everybody.

[Austen Allred] 13:35:46
So those could happen on weekends. But the weekends, not a lot is planned. Your project submissions will be due in the weekend and your opportunities for revisions of the project submission will be in weekends. So a lot of weekends will be project time.

[Austen Allred] 13:36:04
Which of the companies is hiring remote UK workers, the education company?

[Austen Allred] 13:36:09
And they have a bunch of companies under that umbrella. So I say three companies, there's really like Probably technically… 200 companies in all of this world if you count all the trilogy folks But yeah, the one that I know that was like, hey, we actually want people in EU and UK was the education company.

[Austen Allred] 13:36:35
Collaboration, I mean, you're free to share stuff with other people, but you should plan on doing those stuff yourself.

[Austen Allred] 13:36:43
How would trilogy profit if they pay us a million in salary once we're bringing in a million ARR?

[Austen Allred] 13:36:49
They want to grow it beyond a million ARR.

[Austen Allred] 13:36:54
Why is Trilogy state successful? I think it's because they are phenomenally good at operating software companies.

[Austen Allred] 13:37:01
They are… And frankly, in the 90s, they leaned into the internet before the internet was cool. And I think they see the same thing happening that they're leaning into AI before AI has fully, I mean, it's cool obviously the internet was cool

[Austen Allred] 13:37:20
But they went all in and figured it out in a way that other companies didn't.

[Austen Allred] 13:37:24
And now they're so wildly profitable you know they they just keep winning.

[Austen Allred] 13:37:35
I think we answered that. Yeah, these questions are from an hour ago.

[Austen Allred] 13:37:41
Will official admission statistics be available or posted in the near future?

[Austen Allred] 13:37:44
I don't know. There's some, I mean, I don't have like a reason not to post it, but I don't want to I don't want to set an expectation of posting everything that is internal.

[Austen Allred] 13:37:56
But yeah. Weekends will be pretty much project time. I think we've talked about that.

[Austen Allred] 13:38:07
The estimated retail value of the entire 12 weeks, I don't know the answer to that, what that means.

[Austen Allred] 13:38:16
Will there be gauntlet swag? Yes. Could some of the employers hire people at 200k remote or imagine they will after?

[Austen Allred] 13:38:25
I mean, they're… They're welcome to do what they would like to do. But I know that for this program, they very specifically wanted everybody in Austin So yeah.

[Austen Allred] 13:38:39
Can you share more about the section leaders? These are, I mean.

[Austen Allred] 13:38:43
You can think of them as basically helpers and TAs. So the extent possible, we bring in people who are really good with AI.

[Austen Allred] 13:38:51
They're also going to be people More in the Austin section whose entire job is logistics and housing and Stuff like that. But yeah, we're, we'll we'll have a… a quiver of folks who are really good at AI on hand to try to help with anything that needs help. Some of it will be informal office hours. Some of it's just folks standing by.

[Austen Allred] 13:39:16
My favorite unknown follows on X for AI. I created a couple of lists. So you can go to my x x.com slash Austin, A-O-S-T-E-N, and go through my lists and I keep them all in there.

[Austen Allred] 13:39:32
Yeah, this is a really good question. Large scale technological disemployment.

[Austen Allred] 13:39:38
I agree that it's really difficult to imagine what life is going to be like in five years.

[Austen Allred] 13:39:44
I don't. Um… Yeah, it's so hard to wrap your mind around.

[Austen Allred] 13:39:52
Look, there are definitely going to be pockets of underemployment in different industries and different fields. So the way that I'm coping with that is to stay on the cutting edge of AI. I think if you can create as much, the more value you can create.

[Austen Allred] 13:40:06
The more value you are going to bring to the world, how much of that is displaced by AI? It's really difficult to say.

[Austen Allred] 13:40:12
That's the entire reason Gauntlet exists. I mean, yeah, to be blunt, there are already shifts happening Where if all you can do is write basic JavaScript.

[Austen Allred] 13:40:24
And AI can do that, then you need someone to coordinate AI to do all of that, which is what we're teaching you guys to do.

[Austen Allred] 13:40:31
You don't need as many people um just writing code if AI does that reasonably well so I don't know what the future is going to look like, but I think… You're all really, really lucky to be where you are.

[Austen Allred] 13:40:49
Is any of this going to be in a contract? Yeah, it's… Like a light contract, I would say.

[Austen Allred] 13:40:56
I mean, the… Like the way they know that they're going to cover expenses is we're not going to like we're not going to Like, have you pay for anything and pay you back. We're just covering it all. So… Yeah, there's not like…

[Austen Allred] 13:41:12
Yeah, when you fly to Austin, we're going to buy you the tickets. When you have a hotel in Austin, we're paying for the hotel room.

[Austen Allred] 13:41:18
You show up in the office and there's food in Austin that's paid for by us. So there's not anything to go back on.

[Austen Allred] 13:41:28
Yeah, project submissions will generally be Friday and then try to get you feedback on Saturday.

[Austen Allred] 13:41:34
That kind of thing. We're going to need a haircut shave at least Once, oh, sorry, I thought that said at Once in… In that time.

[Austen Allred] 13:41:48
Look, if you you know if you if you don't have 15 bucks to cover a haircut, let me know and we can find a way to cover it. We don't have… any plans or policies for this is the haircut?

[Austen Allred] 13:41:59
Budget. But yeah.

[Austen Allred] 13:42:06
I think we've answered all of them.

[Austen Allred] 13:42:12
Well, any of the companies require less crazy hours than others. Yeah, we're going to take that into consideration.

[Austen Allred] 13:42:18
The reason we… like anticipate startup like hours for this stuff isn't because you're going to be writing code 80 hours a week.

[Austen Allred] 13:42:28
It's because… it's like a lot of the time is just staying up on the cutting edge of AI and adapting.

[Austen Allred] 13:42:36
So yeah, there are going to be companies that are 60 hours, companies that are 80 hours. There are going to be options for If you want to go really hardcore and work 100 hours, not all of it's explicit, like you're not like checking a box saying, I agree to work 100 hours a week

[Austen Allred] 13:42:51
But… Yeah, I would anticipate none of the jobs being like a hard nine to five, 40 hour a week thing And if you're willing to work hard, then we can figure it out from there.

[Austen Allred] 13:43:06
Is there any possibility of additional companies joining to hire gauntlet grads from the cohort?

[Austen Allred] 13:43:11
This cohort's going to be 100% these three companies, mostly because we're not going to fill their need.

[Austen Allred] 13:43:17
In the future, I'm sure we'll have to figure out how to open it up to other people.

[Austen Allred] 13:43:23
But yeah.

[Austen Allred] 13:43:28
Yep, I'll be in Austin. Pretty much the entire time.

[Austen Allred] 13:43:35
Yeah, I'll be there. I'll meet you guys for sure.

[Austen Allred] 13:43:39
I've got, obviously, you know, I have other stuff that I do that's not all gauntlet. So I'll be doing other things, not 100% Gauntlet, 100% of the time.

[Austen Allred] 13:43:48
But I'll definitely be there. Yeah.

[Austen Allred] 13:43:56
Did he fail anyone who didn't do well on the coding part? Yeah.

[Austen Allred] 13:44:03
When you give someone for forgetting to turn it off and not safe for work stuff pops up.

[Austen Allred] 13:44:08
Yeah, I mean… Look, we're not going to be looking for it, but yeah, you should try to avoid it.

[Austen Allred] 13:44:16
I have an existing company that I've formed and putting it on pause for this. Is this something Trilogy would be mad about.

[Austen Allred] 13:44:22
No. Well, they want to transfer that under the ventures program?

[Austen Allred] 13:44:27
Maybe. They'd probably like just hire you and have you build something for them Or, you know, you go do your own thing.

[Austen Allred] 13:44:38
Are there any legal concerns with the cognitive testing since the program can be construed as a hiring program? I don't think so.

[Austen Allred] 13:44:44
I mean, we've… First of all, we're a school But… companies use similar testing to hire directly as well.

[Austen Allred] 13:44:55
Do we have to use X? Yeah, we're just going to require you to use X for this submission stuff.

[Austen Allred] 13:45:02
Just because it's easier. And that's where AI stuff is happening.

[Austen Allred] 13:45:09
But if it's an account that you only use to submit this stuff that no one ever sees, that's fine. That'll meet the goals a requirement, but I have yet to see any serious ai conversational knowledge being shared on blue sky or threads. So that's why we're using X.

[Austen Allred] 13:45:28
I mean, my community is skeptical. Anything I can share to assure them that it'll be fine. I mean, I'll send you a… handbook later. You can send them links to stuff about Trilogy university And say that's what we're rebuilding again, that usually works pretty well.

[Austen Allred] 13:45:45
I think we answered that. I mean, we'll help you a little bit. We'll help you know how to build stuff.

[Austen Allred] 13:45:54
With AI, but we're not going to be like, here's step one for building Slack.

[Austen Allred] 13:45:58
A lot of that's going to be figuring out yourselves.

[Austen Allred] 13:46:04
Will Sam Altman be a speaker during Gauntlet? There will be somebody from OpenAI.

[Austen Allred] 13:46:09
I'm friends with Sam, but he's probably one of the most busy people on the planet yet. So I don't know if he'll be able to to zoom in for a night. I hope so, but we'll see.

[Austen Allred] 13:46:22
Can we drive to Austin and park our car at the hotel? I don't know yet.

[Austen Allred] 13:46:31
What's the name of the sponsoring education company again? I don't know.

[Austen Allred] 13:46:37
No, there is a name for it. Well, I'm sure there is a corporate name for it. I don't know if you'd be able to find anything under that corporate name and I don't know what the name of the education company is.

[Austen Allred] 13:46:48
I know they run… Alpha High School in Austin.

[Austen Allred] 13:46:52
And a whole bunch of other schools and i don't I mean, this is kind of the way Trilogy operates And these companies they have these companies tons and tons of different companies that all work together.

[Austen Allred] 13:47:07
So yeah. Does monitoring software actually help productivity? Yeah, I've been Like, I think it's actually really important for you personally. We're going to talk about Scheduling and how to like stay productive It probably, like we're not going to use all the features for it.

[Austen Allred] 13:47:30
The software itself is overkill relative to what we actually need.

[Austen Allred] 13:47:35
But the parts that we do need, it's a lot easier to use the existing software than to go build something new that has fewer of the features.

[Austen Allred] 13:47:44
So I apologize if it seems overbearing. It's just the simplest way to get stuff done.

[Austen Allred] 13:47:54
When you say AI is writing all the code, what happens when the project can no longer fit into the context window?

[Austen Allred] 13:48:00
That's a really, really good question we're going to be talking about a whole lot.

[Austen Allred] 13:48:05
In due time, in due time.

[Austen Allred] 13:48:12
How much opportunity is there for it to personalize? Yeah, I mean, all of the Yeah, there's tons of opportunity to personalize it.

[Austen Allred] 13:48:23
I haven't seen anything valuable related to AI stuff on Blue Sky.

[Austen Allred] 13:48:28
So many links, I'll check it out. But yeah, right now the plan is X.

[Austen Allred] 13:48:35
