If the client-side redirect approach is still causing Hook ordering issues, the simplest **alternative** is to move your auth check into a **server component**. This avoids calling React hooks for redirects altogether, and ensures unauthenticated users get redirected before rendering any UI.

---

## 1. Use a **Server Component** in `app/layout.tsx`

In Next.js App Router, you can define a “root” or “global” layout that wraps all pages. If you perform the auth check here on the server side (using Clerk’s `auth()` instead of the client-side `useAuth` hook), React hooks in your client component won't ever conditionally shift order.

**File:** `app/layout.tsx`
```tsx
import { auth } from "@clerk/nextjs";
import { redirect } from "next/navigation";
import "../globals.css"; // or any global styles

export const metadata = {
  title: "Slack Clone",
  description: "A modern Slack clone built with Next.js",
};

// This is a **server component** by default (no "use client").
export default function RootLayout({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  const { userId } = auth(); // Get user info server-side

  // If user is not signed in, server-side redirect to /sign-in
  if (!userId) {
    redirect("/sign-in");
  }

  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        {children}
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```
**Why This Works**  
- `auth()` runs on the server. If there’s no logged-in user, we immediately call `redirect("/sign-in")`.  
- The user never hits any client-side Hook logic.  

## 4. Additional Tips

1. **Ensure** `app/layout.tsx` is a **server component**  
   - By default, `layout.tsx` is a server component unless you put `"use client"` at the top.  
2. **Check** other conditionals  
   - If you have other logic in `Home()` that might skip calling a Hook, ensure that’s also unconditional.  
3. **One Layout, Many Pages**  
   - If you only want to protect certain routes, you can place the server-side check in a nested layout (e.g., `app/(protected)/layout.tsx`).

### Summary

- Put the redirect logic in a server-side `layout.tsx` using Clerk’s `auth()`.  
- Remove the old “if (!userId) { useEffect(...) }” approach from your client code.  
- This should completely resolve the Hook ordering error and let your Slack clone load properly for authenticated users.
